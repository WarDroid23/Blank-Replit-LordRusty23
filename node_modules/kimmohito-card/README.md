It's me, Kim Mohito!

# Usage

## npm
```
npx kimmohito-card
```

## GitHub Package Registry
Assuming you have the GitHub registry set up, you can use via npx:
```
npx @kimmohito/kimmohito-card
```

Not including how to use it globally because I'm not sure why you'd want this as a global command. That'd be creepy.
